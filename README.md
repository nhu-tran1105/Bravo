## üìñ Overview
This is a simple web-based Memory Cards game where players match pairs of animal cards.  
The game demonstrates modern JavaScript (ES modules), responsive CSS Grid, Bootstrap 5 components, and state persistence using Web Storage.

Players can track their **Score** and **High Score**, restart the game, and change the theme. A settings form allows the player to save their name and preferred theme.

## üíª Game Rules
1. Click on a card to flip it over.  
2. Flip a second card to try to find a matching pair.  
3. If the cards match, your **score increases**.  
4. If they do not match, they flip back automatically.  
5. The game continues until all pairs are matched.  
6. Click **Restart** to start a new game.  
7. The **High Score** persists between sessions.

## üíª Code Snippet
Below is a key function from the game logic ‚Äî it checks for matching cards and updates the score using localStorage and cookies:

```javascripts
function disableCards() {
  firstCard.removeEventListener("click", flipCard);
  secondCard.removeEventListener("click", flipCard);
  score++;
  scoreElement.textContent = score;

  const highScoreElement = document.querySelector(".high-score");
  saveScore(score);
  highScoreElement.textContent = getHighScore();

  const playerName = localStorage.getItem("playerName") || "Guest";
  savePlayerStats(playerName, score);
  checkWin(); 
  resetBoard();
}
```

---

## Explanation:
This function runs when two flipped cards match. It:
1. Disables further clicks on the matched pair
2. Increases and displays the score
3. Updates the high score using localStorage
4. Saves player stats (name and score) as a cookie
5. Checks if the player has completed all pairs
